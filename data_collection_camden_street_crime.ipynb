    "<h1>Additional Data Collection through Police API</h1>\n",
    "In this notebook, we perform initial data analysis on the dataset downloaded from the London Borough of Camden link <a href='https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/Crime-and-Criminal-Justice/On-Street-Crime-In-Camden/qeje-7ve7'>here</a>. We first identify the 'Neighbourhood ID's [Ward Code and Names] of Camden neighbourhoods in order to retrieve the <strong>street crimes</strong> data within those areas from the Police API directly.<br/>\n",
    "Subsequently, we perform some initial checks whether the data of the stored dataset from Camden [CSV] matches with the retrieved ones - one such sample check can be found in this notebook <a href='verify_police_api_and_camden_stored_dataset.ipynb'>here</a>. Some reflections can be fiound inside the Conclusion section.<br/>\n",
    "We retrieve addtional data that are available through the Police API but does not exist inside this Camden dataset. For example, the Camden dataset only contains data upto August, 2019 but Police API data for neighbourhoods are updated monthly. Currently, the crime data can be retreived upto December, 2020. Therefore, we retrieve addtional data from this API from September, 2019 upto December, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following data retrieval process is achieved by going through the Police API Client implementation in Python as described <a href=\"https://police-api-client-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">here</a>. Plenty of data manipulation was required in order to make this additional dataset shape consistent with the available Camden dataset on top of going through the Police API carefully."

    "1. Inside the Camden dataset [CSV], if the crime Outcome Category and its Date are NaN, then those records were discarded. Police API retrieved such records which were not present in the CSV dataset for previous years. This was revealed during checking whether the Police API retrieved data from pervious years largely match this CSV dataset. Except those entries - they were largely similar.<br/>\n",
    "2. It was also revealed that the Camden dataset's crime Outcome does not consist of latest updates which can be obtained through Police API. For example, many were <strong>under investigation</strong> inside the CSV dataset which are changed to <strong>status update unavailable</strong> later. This is not captured inside the dataset.<br/>\n",
    "3. Police API's way of identifying some neighbourhood [e.g., Swiss Cottage, Camden Town with Primrose Hill, Highgate and Regent's Park] has been changed from the time the Camden dataset was created. Some additional preprocessing steps were required to make both data [CSV dataset and addtional data retrieved through Police API] consistent.<br/>\n",
